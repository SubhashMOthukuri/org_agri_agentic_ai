1️⃣ Define the Problem Clearly

Before coding, I’d ask:

What exactly are we solving?

Predict supply chain risk for organic farms to reduce crop loss and optimize logistics.

Who are the stakeholders?

Farmers, suppliers, agri-businesses, regional managers, enterprises.

Why does it matter?

Crop loss impacts revenue, food security, and ESG goals.

How will success be measured?

Reduction in crop loss (%), revenue improvement, prediction accuracy, SLA for alerts.

Principle: If I can explain the problem in one sentence including stakeholder, pain point, and value, I understand it deeply.

2️⃣ Understand Data & Inputs

Big Tech engineers spend 50% of time understanding data before building models. Questions I’d ask:

What data exists?

Weather: Forecasts, anomalies, historical patterns.

Market: Crop prices, demand, supply delays.

Pest/Disease: IoT sensors, research alerts, satellite imagery.

What is missing or unreliable?

Sparse sensors, inconsistent market reports.

What preprocessing is needed?

Normalize metrics, handle missing values, align timestamps.

How often does data update?

Real-time for alerts, daily for trends, historical for ML training.

Principle: A model is only as good as the data you feed into it.

3️⃣ Define Agents & Roles

Map every component to a “responsibility” before coding:

WeatherDataAgent: Collect weather signals.

MarketTrendAgent: Track crop prices & demand.

PestDiseaseAgent: Detect pest/disease risk.

SupplyChainRiskPredictor: ML-based risk scoring.

ActionRecommender: Prescriptive actions for farmers/suppliers.

NotificationAgent: Deliver insights via dashboard/email/SMS.

Ask: What are dependencies between agents?

Weather + Market + Pest → Predictor → Recommender → Notifications.

Ask: Which agents require real-time data vs batch updates?

Principle: Clear responsibility mapping prevents messy code and hidden bugs.

4️⃣ Identify Success Metrics & KPIs

For a Big Tech system, everything is measurable. Before coding, define:

Prediction Metrics: Accuracy, F1, precision/recall.

Business Metrics: % reduction in crop loss, revenue improvement, supply chain delays reduced.

System Metrics: Latency, uptime, scalability, GPU usage.

Ensure metrics are tracked from day one.

Principle: “If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.”

5️⃣ Consider System Constraints

Scale: 100 farms vs 1 million farms → architecture differs.

Latency: Farmers need near real-time alerts.

Cost: Cloud GPU inference, storage, and data pipelines.

Reliability: Failures in data collection or prediction can cause huge financial losses.

Principle: Understand engineering constraints first, then design architecture.

6️⃣ Sketch Architecture & Workflow

Draw end-to-end flow: data sources → agents → ML → decision → dashboard/alerts.

Include data types, formats, frequency, and feedback loops.

Principle: A picture (diagram) is worth 1000 lines of code.

7️⃣ Prototype Thought Process (Before Coding)

Use mock data to simulate end-to-end flow.

Check if predictions + actions make sense logically.

Ask: “Will this scale? Will a farmer find this actionable? Can a manager trust it?”

Principle: Validate conceptually and with synthetic data before committing to real infrastructure.

8️⃣ Risk & Edge Cases

Missing data → fallback strategies?

Conflicting predictions → how to resolve?

Rare events (flood, pest outbreak) → model should handle outliers.

Principle: Think “what can break in production?” before coding.
