# Governance Rules - Enterprise Prototype (FAANG-style)

1. Error States:
   - Handle empty/loading/error/offline states in frontend and backend.
   - Log all errors with timestamps and context.

2. API Compatibility:
   - Ensure backward compatibility; increment version for breaking changes.

3. Testing:
   - High-quality unit and integration tests required for every feature.
   - Validate ML and agent outputs against synthetic data.

4. Security & Permissions:
   - Review auth flows and permissions on backend changes.
   - Confirm no sensitive data exposure.

5. Feature Flags:
   - Use feature flags for experimental features.
   - Check caching and logging for feature-flagged modules.

6. Logging & Monitoring:
   - Log critical steps of agents, ML predictions, and decisions.
   - Include feature/branch metadata for traceability.

7. One Feature at a Time:
   - Implement and fully validate one feature per branch before moving to the next.
