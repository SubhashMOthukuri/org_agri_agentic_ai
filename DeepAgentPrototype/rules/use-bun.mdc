# Usage Rules - Enterprise Prototype (FAANG-style)

1. API Keys & External Services:
   - Store OpenAI and other API keys securely in environment variables.
   - Limit API calls to control latency and cost during prototype.

2. Dependencies:
   - Only approved libraries allowed; remove unused packages.
   - Prefer lightweight, stable packages for prototyping.

3. Caching & Performance:
   - Implement caching for repeated ML predictions or agent outputs.
   - Reduce unnecessary API calls to improve latency.

4. Data Storage:
   - MongoDB for unstructured prototype data.
   - Preprocessed data can be cached in memory for fast iteration.

5. Fallbacks:
   - Provide default/simulated data if external services fail.
