# Writing Rules - Enterprise Prototype (FAANG-style)

1. Modular Design:
   - Each agent and ML module must be fully modular and independently testable.
   - Maintain clear input/output contracts for every function.

2. Readability & Documentation:
   - Use descriptive variable names, consistent formatting, and comments.
   - Document all assumptions and data transformations.

3. Version Control:
   - One feature per branch; merge only after passing tests and review.
   - Maintain changelog and architecture diagram updates.

4. Data Handling:
   - Validate all inputs; handle empty/loading/error/offline states.
   - Use synthetic data for prototyping; clearly label mocks vs real data.
